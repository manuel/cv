senior software engineering roles in ad- and fintech,
spending most of my time on Linux- and JVM-based
backend systems.

Interests:

* Programming languages
* Operating systems
* Blockchain and tokenization

## Experience

### 2016-07 -- 2021-06 Consultant (remote) at link:https://demyst.com[Demyst Data Ltd.]

Designed and implemented Beluga, a Java-based queryable storage server for
customer-supplied data. Beluga uses Postgres support for JSON and GIN indexes
to allow querying by any combination of columns without having to specify schemas upfront. Beluga
loads data files from Amazon S3 and learns about updates from the queue service SQS.

Designed and implemented Guppy, a Java application for accessing relational
data on customer premises from Demystâ€™s centralised service. A Guppy
adapter is installed on a client system and is connected to the central Guppy
service via reverse HTTP for NAT traversal. The adapter talks to a local
RDBMS via JDBC. Tables thusly connected can be queried with the same
HTTP API as Beluga tables.

Extended and maintained the company's Python toolkit for accessing APIs and data sources
from Jupyter notebooks.

### 2012-08 -- 2016-02 Consultant (remote) at link:https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/collectivemedia[Collective, Inc.]

Designed and led implementation (with two team members) of the link:https://github.com/manuel/celos[Celos] batch
scheduling system for Hadoop. As of 2016, Celos was running all of
Collective's Hadoop processing (more than 300 data processing workflows
across dozens of projects).

* Oversaw the roll-out of Celos to the different data engineering teams and
the porting of legacy workflows to Celos.
* Created continuous deployment tools connected to GitHub/Jenkins to
automate workflow deployment.
* Designed Ansible and runit-based production and staging deployment tooling
for Celos itself.

Developed MapReduce processing programs in Java that transformed Flume
Avro records to TSV for loading into Netezza.

Developed link:https://github.com/manuel/node-avro[node-avro] in C++, a prototype implementation of Avro support for
Node.js.
