## Overview

I have been obsessively programming since 1995.

For the past years I have been working remotely in
senior software engineering roles in ad- and fintech,
spending most of my time on Linux- and JVM-based
backend systems.

Interests:

* Programming languages
* Operating systems
* Blockchain and tokenization
* User interfaces
* Xanalogical media

## Experience

### 2016-07 -- 2021-06 Consultant (remote) at link:https://demyst.com[Demyst Data Ltd.]

Designed and implemented Beluga, a Java-based queryable storage server for
customer-supplied data. Beluga uses Postgres support for JSON and GIN indexes
to allow querying by any combination of columns without having to specify schemas upfront. Beluga
loads data files from Amazon S3 and learns about updates from the queue service SQS.

Designed and implemented Guppy, a Java application for accessing relational
data on customer premises from Demystâ€™s centralised service. A Guppy
adapter is installed on a client system and is connected to the central Guppy
service via reverse HTTP for NAT traversal. The adapter talks to a local
RDBMS via JDBC. Tables thusly connected can be queried with the same
HTTP API as Beluga tables.

Extended and maintained the company's Python toolkit for accessing APIs and data sources
from Jupyter notebooks.

### 2012-08 -- 2016-02 Consultant (remote) at link:https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/collectivemedia[Collective, Inc.]

Designed and led implementation (with two team members) of the link:https://github.com/manuel/celos[Celos] batch
scheduling system for Hadoop. As of 2016, Celos was running all of
Collective's Hadoop processing (more than 300 data processing workflows
across dozens of projects).

* Oversaw the roll-out of Celos to the different data engineering teams and
the porting of legacy workflows to Celos.
* Created continuous deployment tools connected to GitHub/Jenkins to
automate workflow deployment.
* Designed Ansible and runit-based production and staging deployment tooling
for Celos itself.

Developed MapReduce processing programs in Java that transformed Flume
Avro records to TSV for loading into Netezza.

Developed link:https://github.com/manuel/node-avro[node-avro] in C++, a prototype implementation of Avro support for
Node.js.

### 2011-09 -- 2012-07 Computer science teacher at link:https://bg-sillgasse.tsn.at/[Bundesgymnasium und Bundesrealgymnasium Sillgasse]

Tried my hand at teaching kids how to code using browser-based JavaScript
game frameworks and the GameMaker tool.

### 2008-02 -- 2009-01 Consultant at link:https://www.mpreis.at/[MPreis Warenvertriebs GmbH], an Austrian chain of
supermarkets

Created Java programs for the visualization of each supermarket's stock
interfacing with data coming from an internal Oracle database.

Advisor for project creating home delivery system. 

### 2005-03 -- 2006-05 Lead Software Architect at System One (now link:https://www.semanticlabs.at/[Semantic Labs])

Planned and implemented hypermedia content management systems based on
MySQL and Java Content Repository.

Implemented a service-oriented API for communication between database
backend and web frontend.

Integrated text classifcation tools (GATE) into the company's semantic wiki. 

### 2001-03 -- 2002-09 Bioinformatician at the link:https://www.tkfi.at/[Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute]

Created Java applications for visualizing results of microarray
experiments.

Transformed text-based genomics databases with Ruby and Unix tools.

SQL database design for effciently querying genomics data.

Created content management system for institute website.

### Since 1995 Various consulting projects

Consulting, design, and implementation for web content management

## Open Source code

### Celos (Java): Scheduler for Hadoop workflows

https://github.com/manuel/celos

I never got around to promoting this project, but it has a nice architecture and was
used at a couple of companies successfully, and users liked it ("It's a gamechanger!").

### LispX (JavaScript): Ultralight Lisp for the Web

https://github.com/lispx/lispx

As of 2022, this is my current hobby project.

### Ell (C): Executable and Linkable Lisp

https://github.com/manuel/ell

A fun hack to implement a Lisp that compiles to C by calling out `gcc`
and then `dlopen`ing the produced binary in the running process.

### Buckybase (Python): Hypermicrodatabase

https://github.com/manuel/buckybase-py

http://buckybase.blogspot.com/2008/06/introducing-buckybase.html

An early attempt to create a hyperlinked personal database on Google AppEngine.
